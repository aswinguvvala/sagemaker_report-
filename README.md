My main goal was to achieve high performance on Kaggle competitions, which led me to push the boundaries of what I knew, especially using TensorFlow and AWS SageMaker's flexible features.

At the heart of my work was creating a model that could accurately classify images. I used advanced techniques like convolutional neural networks and tried out different complex designs, including VGG16(fig 1), ResNet50 , ResNet101(fig
2)ResNet152 all equipped with ImageNet weights. These models were great because they use something called skip connections, which help the model learn from huge amounts of data without getting overwhelmed.
